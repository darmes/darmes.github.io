    <p>Hi! Welcome to my site!</p>
    <p>My name's David and I'm a senior software engineer, a proven leader, and a gamer.</p>
    <p>
      I've been writing code for over 10 years. I have a wide breadth of technical knowledge,
      including artificial intelligence, frontend frameworks, backend web services, microservices,
      relational, and non-relational databases.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a veteran with combat tested leadership skills. I'm trained to educate, mentor, and build
      up both individuals and teams. I'm a strong communicator with proficiency explaining technical
      topics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of my favorite games are Shadow of the Colossus, Mass Effect, and Civ 5 - just to name a
      few. I'm an avid gamer and enjoy nearly every genre: FPS, Action, Platformer, Strategy, RPG,
      Roguelike, Sci-Fi, and Simulation. I enjoy making games as much as I enjoy playing them, and
      hope to craft memorable experiences.
